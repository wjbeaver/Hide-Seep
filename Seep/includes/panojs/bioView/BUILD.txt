bioView

http://www.bioimage.ucsb.edu/bioview.html

This software uses Trolltech Qt library and therefore make sure to have 
one installed on your system first. The Qt library is free for Open Source 
development and can be downloaded here: 
  http://www.trolltech.com/
  http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/downloads

The Qt version used is: 4.2, note that qt4 is significantly different from qt3
and therefore will not build on systems with only qt3 installed.

There are some other libraries used besides Qt: libtiff, libjpeg, libpng, zlib
These libraries are needed to show image previews. Their code is located in /libs
the reason why we distribute the sources is historical, fist of all, we had modified 
libtiff that would overcome problems reading many proprietary formats based on it.
Second, we have opted to distribute statically linked image libraries in order to 
avoid any possible trouble with future updated versions.

The Qt project file is used to create bioView, it is file is called "wv.pro"
In order to generate the makefile for your system use "qmake" utility distributed with
Qt library. Some changes in xdma.pro might have to take place, since the autoconf is 
not used you have to make sure the required libraries are linked and configured properly.

Platform specific compilation notes: 
  1) Windows
  2) Mac
  3) Linux

  
-------------------------------------------
1) Windows
-------------------------------------------

Visual Studio:
If the Visual C++ 2003 is used then the solution and project files can be found in the root directory.
If any newer VC is used (2005 or above) the solution will be automatically updated. There are image 
libraries prebuild with VC2003 in /libs, if other version of VC are used they might have to be rebuild.

Other compilers:
In order to use other compilers the qmake utility should be used in order to generate the appropriate 
makefile. For windows the available modes are: win32-borland, win32-icc, win32-g++, win32-msvc
The qmake can also generate Visual Studio compatible project files.

-------------------------------------------
1) Mac
-------------------------------------------

The qmake utility should be used in order to generate the appropriate makefile using "wv.pro" 
project file. The xcode project can also be generated.
The syntax of make can be found here: http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/qmake-running.html

If dynamically linked Qt is used, make sure to verify the bioView binary file is pointing to the right 
location of .dylib (or other) files. We suggest to place the needed libraries in 
xdma.app/Contents/Frameworks/ and then use the install_name_tool to point it to the right location.
There are two scripts in the root of xdma source that do just that: macx_update_bin, macx_update_lib.

e.g.: 
qmake wv.pro 
make
./macx_update_lib
./macx_update_bin

-------------------------------------------
1) Linux
-------------------------------------------

The qmake utility should be used in order to generate the appropriate makefile using "wv.pro" 
project file. The syntax of make can be found here: http://doc.trolltech.com/4.1/qmake-running.html

e.g.: 
qmake wv.pro 
make

KDevelop - at the moment, you're on your own, use the supplied xdma.pro file in order to create
the KDevelop project.
